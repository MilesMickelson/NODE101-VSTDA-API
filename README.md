# Node101-VSTDA-API

My fourth project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School. This project teaches you how to 
create an initial set of data points as an array of objects for use on the front end from the back. 
First, creating a route to view all of the objects and then create unique ones for each indiviudal 
object to be viewed by its unique identifier. Second, adding a new unique item to that array of objects 
on the server. And finally third, delete one of the items out of that array by a unique id.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
