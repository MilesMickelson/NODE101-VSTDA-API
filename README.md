# Node101-VSTDA-API

My fourth project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School. This project teaches you how to 
create an initial set of data points as an array of objects in the server for use on the front end. 
First, creating a route to view all of the objects and then create unique ones for each indiviudal 
object to be viewed by its unique identifier. Second, adding a new unique item to that array of objects 
on the server, and third, deleting one of the items out of that array by using a unique id.

#### Please feel free to review the code in this repository as there is no front end feature to visualize.
